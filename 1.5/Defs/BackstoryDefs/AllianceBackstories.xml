		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up on a border colony world, where [PAWN_pronoun] worked the farmland for their family. Their only entertainment came in the form of Blasto movies and videos over the net. [PAWN_nameDef] came to define their entire youth in the continuity of Blasto movies, and from their Blasto Bedsheets to their Blasto jackets, they patterned their entire life after the Hanhar Spectre. This lead to some social outcasting, but they didn't care-- they were busy on Blasto chatrooms with their Extranet friends.</description>
